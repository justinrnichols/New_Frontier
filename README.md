# New Frontier

New Frontier is a text-based adventure game that randomly brings the user on a tremulous trail to the new frontier of America during the 19th century. 
The user can experience any number of mishaps along the way, including lack of food, broken wagon, dead ox, etc. The user must manage their limited money
wisely in order to have enough to survive and make it to the end of the trail. Watch out! The user can fall ill on this unsafe journey and may succumb to 
dysentery.

The game is heavily based on the widely distinguished Oregon Trail game released in 1971 and is purely used for my own enjoyment and is not meant to be
produced.

New Frontier was originally coded in C++ and was then translated to Java for greater flexibility.

## How to Play
Download the Java or C++ code and run it in a terminal.
Alternatively, the code can be put in an IDE of choice to run.
Both version contain a main function that will be executed to start the game.
